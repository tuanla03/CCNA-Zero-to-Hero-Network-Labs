1. Cisco CLI Operating Modes

Cisco devices use a hierarchical structure for their Command Line Interface (CLI). You must navigate through these modes in order to access specific functions:

User EXEC Mode (Router>): The default mode upon login. It allows basic monitoring and limited "show" commands but does not permit configuration changes.

Privileged EXEC Mode (Router#): Accessed by typing enable. This mode provides full access to device information.

Global Configuration Mode (Router(config)#): Accessed by typing configure terminal. This is where actual changes (like hostnames or IP addresses) are made to the device.


2. Device Identification and Security

Securing your network devices is a critical first step in any deployment:

Hostname: Assigning a unique hostname is essential for identifying the device within the network, especially when managing multiple routers and switches.

Passwords: Setting console and enable passwords creates the first line of defense against unauthorized physical or remote access.

Password Encryption: By default, some passwords appear in plain text. Enabling encryption ensures that sensitive credentials remain hidden if someone views the configuration file.


3. Interface Activation and IP Addressing

Unlike Switch interfaces, Cisco Router interfaces are disabled (administratively down) by default for security reasons.

You must manually issue the no shutdown command to "turn on" the port and allow traffic to flow.

IP Addressing: An IP address acts as a logical identity for a device on a network. In this lab, the Router acts as a "gateway," allowing data to travel between two different local networks (192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24).

Note on Switches: In this basic lab, the switches (SW1 and SW2) function as plug-and-play devices (Layer 2) that simply connect multiple devices within the same network. We do not configure them here to focus purely on the routing and initial setup logic.


4. Verification with Ping

Ping is a fundamental diagnostic tool used to test reachability. It sends a small packet (ICMP Echo Request) to a destination IP Address. If the destination receives it, they'll sends a reply back(ICMP Echo Reply), it confirms that the physical cables, IP settings, and routing paths are all functioning correctly.
